Objective of each script

This repository contains three Python scripts that cover fundamental programming concepts:  
1. datatypes.py - Understanding and working with different data types in Python such as int, float, complex, list, tuple, dict, set, and bool.
                 - Casting in python using constructor functions:int(), float(), complex()
                 - using type() function to get the data type of any object.
2. modular_functions.py - Demonstrating the use of functions to perform specific task. In this case to  calculate and return the area of the given shape.
3. control_structures.py - Implementing control structures such as loops(for loop, while loop) and conditionals(if,...else).


 How to Run the Scripts  

1. Run 'datatypes.py'
This script demonstrates how Python handles different data types such as strings, integers, floats, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.  

 To execute: 
type in command prompt:
         python datatypes.py

2. Run modular_functions.py
This script showcases how to define and use functions effectively, promoting modular programming.  

To execute: 
type in command prompt:
                   python modular_functions.py


3.Run control_structures.py
This script includes examples of loops (`for` and `while`), conditional statements (`if-elif-else`), and other control structures.  

To execute:
type in command prompt:
        python control_structures.py


 What I Learned  
Through this exercise, I learned:  
 1) The importance of data types in Python and how they impact operations.  
 2) How to structure Python programs using modular functions for better readability and reuse.  
 3) The role of control structures in decision-making and flow control within a program.

This hands-on practice deepened my understanding of Python basic and helped to refine my coding skills.
